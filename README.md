I have been working with selenium and web-scraping for a while now, but this project raised some challenges, but I learned some things in class that helped to streamline the program as well.

I struggled with finguring out how to load the dynamically loaded webpage with all of the nike shoes. If I didn't load the entire webpage, the html wouldn't load and therefore I would get only a fraction of the skus. I had to refer to the internet to find a way in which to load a dynamic webpage entirely, but I edited the solution to fit my needs.

The other struggle I had was figuring out how to use the discord embeds function, but after much tinkering and documentation I was able to use embeds successfully.

Lastly, I couldn't get nike stock numbers without violating the websites terms of service as they aren't public access, and I am not at the point where I can scrape backend data from nike.

Overall, the project was a success and I'm proud of the outcome.
