# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

My original idea was to submit my resell order checker, but after talking to Prof Rosen I'm coming up with a new idea that's less in the grey.

I'm gonna make a program that the user can put in a link to a nike shoe or the SKU of the shoe, and the program will return if the shoe is available on the NIKE webiste, and if it is, it will return what sizes are available and the price.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A - Alone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

After discussing the final project with Prof Rosen, all my questions have been answered, and I'm confident this program will fit the requirements and not be considered a 'grey area'.
